# Introduciton

This GitHub repo contains sample scripts and data used for the World Bank Poverty Global Practice's Summer University course entitled "Introduction to R and R-shiny As Tools for Building Interactive Geospatial Dashboards", which took place virtually on July 14-15, 2022.

# Scripts

In the code folder, you find two R scripts:
* 1.basic_exercise.R - Runs basic scripts to read, clean, and map sf and raster data
* 2.dashboard.R - Runs three variants of a simple geospatial dashboard:
** app_step1/app.R - an example of a static geospatial dashboard without any reactivity
** app_step2/app.R - an example of a geospatial dashboard with reactivity
** app_step3/app.R - an example of a geospatial dashboard with reactivity which can be deployed on a RStudio Connect server
